## Payment Methods Integration

- Success page includes mobile money branding
- Handles Tanzanian phone number validation

### Card Payment (Pesapal)

- Shows secure payment notice
- Success page includes card payment details

## Success Page Navigation

The success page is automatically opened when payment completes successfully:

```javascript
// Mobile Money Success
const successUrl = `/payment/success?transactionId=${result.transactionId}&amount=${amount}&paymentMethod=mobile_money`;
navigate(successUrl);

// Card Payment Success
const successUrl = `/payment/success?transactionId=${result.merchant_reference}&amount=${amount}&paymentMethod=card`;
navigate(successUrl);
```

## Responsive Design

Both components are fully responsive:

- Accessible color contrast
- Loading states and animations

## Error Handling

## Testing Scenarios

### Success Page Testing:
