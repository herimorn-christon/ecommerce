# Wishlist Functionality Documentation

This document outlines the wishlist functionality in the Digital Marketplace application.

## Wishlist Overview

The wishlist feature has been implemented as a local-first, Redux-persisted solution. This means:

1. Wishlist data is stored in the client's browser using Redux persistence
2. No server API calls are made for wishlist operations
3. Wishlist data persists across browser sessions
4. Changes are immediately reflected in the UI

## Core Components

- **WishlistButton**: A toggleable button component for adding/removing items from wishlist
- **WishlistPage**: Displays all items in the user's wishlist
- **ProductCard**: Contains the WishlistButton for each product in listings

## Redux Implementation

The wishlist is managed through the `wishlistSlice.ts` Redux slice, which:

- Stores a list of product IDs in the wishlist
- Provides actions to add, remove, and toggle products in the wishlist
- Uses Redux Persist to save the wishlist data locally

## Features

1. **Add to Wishlist**:

   - Click heart icon on product cards or product details page
   - Item is immediately added to wishlist

2. **Remove from Wishlist**:

   - Click filled heart icon on product cards or product details page
   - Click remove button on WishlistPage
   - Item is immediately removed from wishlist

3. **View Wishlist**:

   - Navigate to /wishlist route
   - See all items added to wishlist
   - Add items from wishlist directly to cart

4. **Persistence**:
   - Wishlist data persists even when browser is closed
   - Wishlist is available immediately on next visit

## User Experience

- Heart icon is filled for items in wishlist, outline for items not in wishlist
- Adding/removing from wishlist is immediate with no loading states
- Wishlist count is displayed in the header navigation
- WishlistPage shows product images, names, prices, and options to add to cart or remove

## Technical Note

The wishlist implementation doesn't require server authentication, making it available for both logged-in and non-logged-in users. However, the wishlist route is protected, so users will need to log in to view their wishlist page, even though the wishlist functionality works without logging in.
